# SecureWebAppOnAzure

## Prerequisites:

1. All participants must have Visual Studio 2019 installed
2. All participants must have an active Azure subscription as Owner (ITLabs azure subscription doesnt allow creating users/tenants etc....so you need to have another azure subscription)
3. The WebApp that will be securely deployed to Azure will be provided through GitHub (the application is with some code so it can work and during the workshop we will add the code for security purposes)
4. The Web App should be opened and build in Visual Studio before the workshop starts


## Cleanup resources

    - Go to your regource-group and click on Delete
2. Cancel your subscription
    - Go to Subrsciptions and click on your subscription
    - Click on Cancel Subscription on the overview page
3. Go to Azure Active Directory, click on App registration and delete your app registrations
